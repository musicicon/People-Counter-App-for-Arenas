# People-Counter-App-for-Arenas
In this web App I've used front end tools a.k.a. CSS HTML and Javascript to make a people counter. You click increment button as people enter the stadium and once a lot is finished you hit the save button which displays the result at bottom and resets the counter. This app has helped me learn the concepts of DOM, Styling, Clean Code and Javascripts.
